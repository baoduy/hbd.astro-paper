## Introduction

In this article, we will learn how to set up a CloudPC with Windows 365 Enterprise to create a secure and efficient Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) for accessing a private AKS environment.

We will cover the essential steps, including configuring network settings, setting up provisioning profiles and policies with Microsoft Intune, and creating an Entra ID group to streamline the provisioning process.

## Obtaining a License

Before we begin the configuration, it is important to ensure that we have a `Windows 365 Enterprise license`. We can either purchase a new license or obtain a trial license through the [Microsoft 365 Admin Center](https://admin.microsoft.com).

> Note: A trial license is available, typically lasting one month, with the possibility of extending it for an additional month.

## Intune Configuration

Since Microsoft Intune is widely used for device management, we will not delve into its setup here. Instead, our focus will be on configuring Windows 365 Enterprise.

### Entra Provision Group

- First, we navigate to **Groups** in the [Microsoft Endpoint Manager Admin Center](https://intune.microsoft.com/#home) and create a new group named `MDM - IT Windows 365`.

- Then, we return to the **Microsoft 365 Admin Center** to assign the license to this group. This step automates the license assignment for all members within the group.

### Creating Provisioning Profiles

Once we have the license ready and assigned to our Entra ID group, we can proceed to create a provisioning profile for Windows 365 Enterprise. This profile will ensure that our CloudPC devices are set up correctly and managed effectively.

- Navigate to **Devices** within Microsoft Intune, and then select **Provisioning** > **Windows 365**.

- We create a new provisioning profile, naming it `Windows 365 - IT Managed`. In this profile, we specify the `Azure network connection` that is configured to allow our CloudPC devices to securely access our VNet environment.

## Provisioning CloudPC Devices

With our profile ready, we can start provisioning CloudPC devices for users. To do this, we need to make sure the target users are part of the `MDM - IT Windows 365` group. After adding users, the provisioning process will automatically start, and the devices will be ready for use within 1 hours.

- Once the provisioning is complete, the assigned users will receive a notification, allowing them to access their CloudPC through the Windows 365 portal.

## Accessing Windows 365

We can access our CloudPC in several ways:

1. **Online Portal Access**: We can access Windows 365 through the [online portal](https://windows365.microsoft.com). This allows us to log in and launch the remote desktop directly within our web browser.

2. **Windows App Access**: Microsoft provides a _Windows App_ that enables us to launch Windows 365 natively. This app is available for download from the Windows 365 online portal. Once installed, we can add the appropriate URL as a workspace and log in using our Entra ID.

   Once the app is installed, we can add the appropriate URL as a workspace and log in using our Entra ID. This setup allows us to launch and access Windows 365 natively on our platform.

3. **Private AKS Access**: Through Windows 365, we can access our private AKS. This setup allows us to manage our private AKS resources, such as namespaces, pods, and deployments, through the Azure portal.

## Conclusion

In this guide, we have successfully set up a CloudPC using Windows 365 Enterprise, configured the necessary provisioning profiles, and ensured secure access to our private AKS environment through a Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI). This setup provides our teams with efficient, secure remote access that integrates seamlessly with our existing infrastructure.
