## Introduction

Welcome to this complete series of articles dedicated to building and enhancing a local Kubernetes environment on Raspberry Pi 4 clusters using K3s. Whether you're just starting your Kubernetes journey or looking to deepen your understanding, this series is designed to provide you with step-by-step guidance through practical implementations.

We'll begin by setting up K3s, a lightweight Kubernetes distribution ideal for resource-constrained devices like the Raspberry Pi. From there, we'll delve into deploying Nginx Ingress for traffic management and explore two methods of implementing SSL certificates: using Cert-Manager and leveraging Cloudflare for a more streamlined approach.

Additionally, we'll cover how to expose your services to the internet without a static IP using Cloudflare Tunnel, and we'll guide you through hosting applications like Outline VPN for secure connections and Longhorn for robust, cloud-native storage solutions.

By the end of this series, you'll have a fully functional Kubernetes environment capable of running and managing complex applications, all from the comfort of your local setup. Let's dive in and start this exciting journey together!

This guide provides helpful tips for installing the Nginx Ingress on a K3s Raspberry Pi 4 cluster.
Detailed and step-by-step instructions will ensure a seamless installation process. Let's get started!

### [Day 03 - Step-By-Step Guide: Installation of Cert-Manager, Implementing Free SSL Certificates for Kubernetes Clusters](/ks-install-cert-manager-free-ssl-kubernetes-cluster)

This comprehensive guide will help you to smoothly install Cert-Manager and implement free SSL certificates for Kubernetes clusters.
It is designed with step-by-step instructions to facilitate a seamless installation process. Dive in and let's begin this journey for enhanced security!

### [Day 04 - Step-By-Step Guide: Cert-Manager Alternative with Cloudflare, Implementing Free SSL Certificates for Kubernetes Clusters](/ks-cert-manager-alternative-with-cloudflare)

We explore the concept of using a Cert-Manager Alternative with Cloudflare to implement free SSL Certificates for Kubernetes clusters.
This strategy leverages Cloudflare SSL certificates conjunction with the Kubernetes setup to provide a secure environment, replacing the need of Cert-Manager.
Discover how this approach simplifies the process, and enhances the security of our Kubernetes clusters.

### [Day 05 - Step-By-Step Guide: Nginx Alternative with Cloudflare Tunnel, Enables services to internet a public static IP address](ks-public-services-with-cloudflare-tunnel)

This robust solution provides a feasible alternative to Nginx when there's no public static IP address or port forwarding required.
This guide walks us through the process step by step, enabling the services online more efficiently.

### [Day 06 - Step-By-Step Guide: Hosting Outline VPN on Kubernetes](/ks-hosting-outline-vpn-kubernetes)

Outline VPN, a comprehensive server and client software tool, is a free and open-source system developed by Google.
In this article, we will delve into the process of hosting Outline VPN on Kubernetes and outlining the steps to expose connection ports via NGINX.

### [Day 07 - Step-By-Step Guide: Hosting Longhorn on K3s (ARM)](/ks-hosting-longhorn-on-k3s-arm)

In this article, we will explore how to deploy Longhorn, a cloud-native distributed block storage system designed for Kubernetes on our K3s (ARM).
Longhorn is known for its lightweight, reliable, and open-source nature, which simplifies the process of adding persistent storage to Kubernetes clusters, making it easier to run stateful applications.
