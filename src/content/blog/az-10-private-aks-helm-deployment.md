## Introduction

In the previous topic, We have successfully imported some docker images into pur private ACR. Based on that we will dive deep into the application Helm deployment for our private AKS.

In our previous article, we covered the process of importing Docker images into a private Azure Container Registry (ACR). Building on that foundation, this guide will walk you through creating a comprehensive Helm deployment pipeline for your private Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster using Azure DevOps.

## Table of Contents

## Prerequisites

- Have AzureDevOps permission to setup the service connection
- Have AKS admin permission to setup Service Account.

Before we begin, ensure you have:

- Appropriate permissions in Azure DevOps to create and manage service connections
- AKS admin access to set up Service Accounts within the cluster
- A private AKS cluster and ACR set up (as covered in our previous articles)
- Basic familiarity with Helm charts and Kubernetes concepts

## AKS Service Account

Before dive into the helm deployment, We need to create an AKS service account that have permission on some of namespaces for deployment purposes.

To start our Helm deployment journey, we first need to create a dedicated Service Account in our AKS cluster. This account will have the necessary permissions to deploy to specific namespaces.
