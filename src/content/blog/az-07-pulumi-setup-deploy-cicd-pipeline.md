## Introduction

In this article, we will guide you through the process of establishing a Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline using Azure DevOps.
This pipeline will facilitate the deployment of the previously developed Pulumi projects.

## Table of Contents

---

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have:

- An Azure DevOps account with a project.
- [Pulumi extensions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=pulumi.build-and-release-task) for Azure DevOps.
- Permissions to deploy resources in your Azure subscription.

## Preparation

### Pulumi Variable Group

Create a variable group in Azure DevOps **Libraries** named `pulumi`, including the Pulumi PAT token:

### Setting Up Azure Resource Management Connection

1. Navigate to **Service connections** in Azure DevOps and create a new connection named `az-pulumi` for **Azure Resource Management**:

   > Note: Specifying a resource group is optional. This can be used to restrict the connection's access to a specific resource group if needed.

2. Once the service connection is established, verify the app registration presence in the Azure Portal here:

   <p class="ml-44"><em>The app registration on Azure Portal</em></p>

3. Ensure the app registration has sufficient permissions to deploy all resources by assigning it the `Owner` and `Key Vault Administrator` roles at the **subscription** level. Additionally, configure the required Graph permissions to provide it with the necessary privileges for comprehensive deployment operations.

## Deployment Templates

### Build Template: `build-template.yml`

- **Parameters**:

  - `stack`: Target Pulumi stack.
  - `workDir`: Working directory of the Pulumi project.

- **Steps**:

  - **Install Node.js**: Version 20.
  - **Setup pnpm**: Configures `pnpm`.
  - **Build Commons Project**: Installs dependencies and runs the build script for `az-commons`.
  - **Install Project Dependencies**: Installs dependencies for the specified `workDir`.

### Deployment Template: `deploy-template.yml`

- **Parameters**:

  - `stack`: Specifies the target Pulumi stack.
  - `workDir`: Defines the working directory of the Pulumi project.
  - `azureSubscription`: Represents the Azure subscription connection.

- **Steps**:

  1. **Install Pulumi CLI**: Installs the latest version of the Pulumi CLI for Linux.
  2. **Pulumi Refresh**: Refreshes the stack if the `pulumi.refresh` parameter is set to true.
  3. **Pulumi Up After Refresh**: Executes `pulumi up` if `pulumi.refresh` is true, ensuring the stack is updated after a refresh.
  4. **Pulumi Up**: Executes `pulumi up` to deploy the stack.
     > Using Pulumi refresh is essential for maintaining accurate state. For more details, refer to [this article](https://www.pulumi.com/blog/repairing-state-with-pulumi-refresh/).

## Pulumi Deployment Pipeline

To configure a deployment pipeline in Azure DevOps, utilize the `deploy.azure-pipelines.yml` file.

### YAML Configuration

- **Trigger**: Automatically activates for branches that match the pattern _releases/\*_.
- **Agent Pool**: Employs the _ubuntu-latest_ agent pool for execution.
- **Variables**: Comprises `pulumi`, `azureSubscription`, and `pnpm_config_cache`. The `env_name` is dynamically generated from the branch name.

### Pipeline Stages

1. **deploy_shared**: Initiates the deployment of the `az-01-shared` module.
2. **deploy_hub**: Proceeds with deploying the `az-02-hub-vnet` module after `deploy_shared` is complete.
3. **deploy_aks**: Continues with the deployment of the `az-03-aks-cluster` module, following `deploy_hub`.
4. **deploy_cloudpc**: Finalizes with the deployment of the `az-04-cloudPC` module, subsequent to `deploy_hub`.

Each stage leverages the `build-and-deploy.yml` file, supplying the required parameters.

To execute the pipeline, create a branch named `releases/dev` and initiate the run:

## Pulumi Destroy Pipeline

This section demonstrates how to safely destroy a Pulumi deployment stack. Exercise caution, as once a stack is destroyed, it cannot be restored.

To set up a destruction pipeline in Azure DevOps, use the `danger-destroy.azure-pipelines.yml` file. To effectively reverse the entire Pulumi deployment, ensure that the states are reverted from the deployment state. Each stage in this process utilizes the `danger-build-and-destroy.yml` file with the necessary parameters.

### Conclusion

In this tutorial, we've successfully set up a CI/CD pipeline using Pulumi and Azure DevOps.
This pipeline automates the deployment of infrastructure, ensuring that our environments are consistent, scalable, and easy to manage.

By leveraging Pulumi's capabilities, we can integrate infrastructure as code into our development workflows, enhancing both efficiency and reliability.
