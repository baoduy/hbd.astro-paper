## Introduction

This is the last article of series **Setting up a private AKS environment on Azure using Pulumi**.
In this article, We'll explore other alternative ways to access to private AKS cluster and Applications to the internet using Cloudflare Tunnel and WARP.

[The Cloudflare WARP client](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/) allows you to protect corporate devices by securely and privately sending traffic from those devices to Cloudflareâ€™s global network, where Cloudflare Gateway can apply advanced web filtering. 
The WARP client also makes it possible to apply advanced **Zero Trust** policies that check for a deviceâ€™s health before it connects to corporate applications.
