## Introduction

In this guide, we will construct a private AKS cluster featuring advanced networking capabilities. We will delve into the integration of the AKS cluster with the Hub VNet and the application of firewall policies established in the [previous `az-02-hub-vnet` project](az-04-pulumi-private-aks-hub-vnet-development).

## Developing the Private AKS Cluster

Our objective is to configure all necessary components for the AKS Cluster, which include:

1. **Resource Group**: A container for organizing related Azure resources.
2. **Container Registry**: This serves as the main repository for all Docker images utilized by our private AKS.
3. **AKS Firewall Rules**: To enable outbound internet connectivity, we must configure firewall rules allowing AKS nodes to communicate with essential Azure resources.
4. **Virtual Network (VNet)**: The primary network hosting our AKS subnets.
5. **AKS Cluster**: An Azure-managed Kubernetes service.

### The `ContainerRegistry.ts` Module

To enhance security and ensure that all Docker images deployed to our AKS cluster are verified, this module establishes a private Container Registry. Instead of opening the firewall to allow AKS to download images from the internet, AKS will be restricted to pulling images exclusively from this private Container Registry.

### The `AksFirewallRules.ts` Module

This module sets up a **FirewallPolicyRuleCollectionGroup** with specific outbound firewall rules, enabling AKS to communicate with essential Azure resources. For more details, please refer to [this documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/outbound-rules-control-egress).

### The `VNet.ts` Module

This module will be a enhanced version of the hub VNet, focusing on improved security and routing:

- **Security Group**: By default, the VNet allows resources in all subnets to access the internet. To enhance security, a security group is created with the following default rules:

  - Block all internet access from all subnets.
  - Allow VNet-to-VNet communication to enable hub-spoke connectivity.
  - Additional security rules can be added through parameters.

  </details>

- **Route Table**: This VNet will peer with the hub, necessitating a route table to direct all traffic to the private IP address of the firewall.

- **VNet**: Finally, the VNet is configured to create the route table and security group, injecting them into all provided subnets. Additionally, it establishes VNet peering with the hub VNet.
