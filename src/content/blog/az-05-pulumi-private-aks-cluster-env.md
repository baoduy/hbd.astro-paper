## Introduction

In this guide, we will construct a private AKS cluster featuring advanced networking capabilities. We will delve into the integration of the AKS cluster with the Hub VNet and the application of firewall policies established in the [previous `az-02-hub-vnet` project](az-04-pulumi-private-aks-hub-vnet-development).

## Developing the Private AKS Cluster

Our objective is to configure all necessary components for the AKS Cluster, which include:

1. **Resource Group**: A container for organizing related Azure resources.
2. **Virtual Network (VNet)**: The primary network hosting our subnets.
3. **Subnets**: Divisions within the VNet to segregate and manage resources.
4. **AKS Firewall Rules**: To enable outbound internet connectivity, we must configure firewall rules allowing AKS nodes to communicate with essential Azure resources.
5. **Container Registry**: This serves as the main repository for all Docker images utilized by our private AKS.
6. **AKS Cluster**: An Azure-managed Kubernetes service.

### The `ContainerRegistry.ts` Module

To enhance security and ensure that all Docker images deployed to our AKS cluster are verified, this module establishes a private Container Registry. Instead of opening the firewall to allow AKS to download images from the internet, AKS will be restricted to pulling images exclusively from this private Container Registry.

### The `AksFirewallRules.ts` Module

This module sets up a **FirewallPolicyRuleCollectionGroup** with specific outbound firewall rules, enabling AKS to communicate with essential Azure resources. For more details, please refer to [this documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/outbound-rules-control-egress).
